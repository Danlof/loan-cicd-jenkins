## A loan Prediction Project
- That is a loan prediction model that uses parameters such as `'Gender', 'Married', 'Dependents', 'Education','Self_Employed', 'ApplicantIncome', 'CoapplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount','Loan_Amount_Term', 'Credit_History', 'Property_Area'` to access or deny an applicant a loan.

- The backend is built using a logistic regression classifier, with a pipeline for data preprocessing, prediction, and testing. 
- The model is deployed on an EC2 instance, where continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) are managed using Jenkins. Additionally, Grafana and Prometheus are integrated for monitoring and performance metrics.
